# dismathportfolio-nathanielmartin

#WEEK 1
* I was able to understand why we need DISMATH
* I never thought we could use math to solve word problems
* It was really interesting to see these new perspectives

#WEEK 2
* We were taught the Logical Connectives and Equivalences
* We also learned about Quantifiers which indicate the generality of an open sentence in which a variable occurs.


#WEEK 3
* We were taught about Rules of Inference
* There are a lot of Rules of Inference that are really tricky
* Direct Proof was also taught to us

#WEEK 4
*We discussed Contraposition also known as indirect proof
*We learned several types of Proof namely Vacuous Proof and Trivial Proof
*Proof by Contradiction is assuming that the premise isn't true, then show that the premise will end up in a contradiction

#WEEK 5
*We discussed about Biconditionals and Mathematical Induction

#Week 6
*We discussed about Recursive/Inductive Definition and Recursive Algorithms
*I also got a glance of Program Verification before I had to go

#Week 7
*We discussed about our project where we will use MIT App Inventor
*We were introduced to Set Theory and Set Identities
*We finally discussed about Cardinality which is the number of elements in a set
